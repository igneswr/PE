<h3>Objective</h3>

<p>
Pandemic Express: Redux is an asymmetric zombie escape movement shooter. At the start of each match, all players spawn as humans, with one randomly selected as the initial zombie.
</p>

<p>
The humans must explore the map, loot weapons, gather resources, and survive long enough to escape using the train. The train acts as the final escape point — reaching it alive means victory.
</p>

<p>
The zombie's objective is to infect all humans. When a human is killed, they turn into a zombie and join the hunt. As the round progresses, the zombie team grows stronger and the humans become more desperate.

Players can unlock special perks by equipping unique costumes. Costumes can be purchased using Stars, which are earned by winning matches or simply playing the game.

Perks provide gameplay advantages and allow different playstyles, helping players survive longer and escape more efficiently.

<ul style="opacity:0.9; line-height:1.8;">

<li><b>Bomber</b> — Explodes to deal massive area damage to humans.</li>

<li><b>Catcher</b> — High health zombie designed to chase and overwhelm survivors.</li>

<li><b>Mimic</b> — Can disguise itself as a human to deceive and ambush survivors.</li>

<li><b>Phantom</b> — Can turn invisible temporarily to surprise and hunt humans.</li>

</ul>

<p>
Each zombie type provides a different strategy and playstyle for infecting humans.

<h3>Winning The Game</h3>

Humans win by surviving and escaping on the train before being infected.
</p>

<p>
Zombies win by infecting every human before they escape.
</p>

<p>
Every match is different, creating intense chases, strategic gameplay, and unpredictable outcomes.
